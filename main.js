`<p>After <span class="word" title="id: existential-threat-1">${existentialThreat1}</span>, <span class="word" title="id: existential-threat-2">${existentialThreat2}</span>, and <span class="word" title="id: existential-threat-3">${existentialThreat3}</span> leveled society as we knew it in <span class="word" title="id: year">${year}</span>, <span class="word" title="id: number">${number}</span> survivors formed a(n) <span class="word" title="id: size-increment">${sizeIncrement}</span> village. There were no institutions or utilities. The people resorted to worshiping <span class="word" title="id: object-1">${object1}</span>, <span class="word" title="id: object-2">${object2}</span>, <span class="word" title="id: object-3">${object3}</span>, <span class="word" title="id: object-4">${object4}</span>, among various other things to cope.</p>

<p>Everything needed to be built from the ground up. There was no system of government, so the most <span class="word" title="id: negative-personality-trait">${negativePersonalityTrait}</span> vied for power in primitive ways. There wasnâ€™t enough organization for all-out war, so most conflicts were petty and between gangs. However, two gangs stood out among the rest. The largest ones, the worshipers of <span class="word" title="id: object-3">${object3}</span> and the worshipers of <span class="word" title="id: object-4">${object4}</span>. </p>

<p>Of course, said gangs were each headed by their most <span class="word" title="id: negative-personality-trait">${negativePersonalityTrait}</span> member. For the <span class="word" title="id: object-3">${object3}</span> worshipers, that was <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-1">${sillyName1}</span>, and for the <span class="word" title="id: object-4">${object4}</span> worshipers, that was <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-2">${sillyName2}</span>.</p>

<p>One <span class="word" title="id: adjective">${adjective}</span> day, <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-2">${sillyName2}</span> decided to challenge <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-1">${sillyName1}</span> to a(n) <span class="word" title="id: contest-type">${contestType}</span> to prove once and for all, who was the most <span class="word" title="id: negative-personality-trait">${negativePersonalityTrait}</span>, which in turn would of course entitle the winner to ultimate control over the village, and the permanent title of <span class="word" title="id: person-title">${personTitle}</span> <span class="word" title="id: insult">${insult}</span>. <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-1">${sillyName1}</span>, of course, agreed, not wanting to be seen by the people as a <span class="word" title="id: positive-personality-trait">${positivePersonalityTrait}</span> person and therefore unfit to rule. They agreed to have the contest <span class="word" title="id: rendezvous">${rendezvous}</span>.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, both <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-2">${sillyName2}</span> and <span class="word" title="id: silly-name-1">${sillyName1}</span> were consumed by <span class="word" title="id: existential-threat-4">${existentialThreat4}</span> before the contest. It was for the best.</p>`;
