      <article id="orig-story">
        <p>After [existential-threat-1], [existential-threat-2], and [existential-threat-3] leveled society as we knew it in [year], [number] survivors formed a(n) [size-increment] village. There were no institutions or utilities. The people resorted to worshiping [object-1], [object-2], [object-3], [object-4], among various other things to cope.</p>

        <p>Everything needed to be built from the ground up. There was no system of government, so the most [negative-personality-trait] vied for power in primitive ways. There wasnâ€™t enough organization for all-out war, so most conflicts were petty and between gangs. However, two gangs stood out among the rest. The largest ones, the worshipers of [object-3] and the worshipers of [object-4]. </p>

        <p>Of course, said gangs were each headed by their most [negative-personality-trait] member. For the [object-3] worshipers, that was [silly-name-1], and for the [object-4] worshipers, that was [silly-name-2].</p>

        <p>One [adjective-1] day, [silly-name-2] decided to challenge [silly-name-1] to a(n) [contest-type] to prove once and for all, who was the most [negative-personality-trait], which in turn would of course entitle the winner to ultimate control over the village, and the permanent title of [person-title] [insult]. [silly-name-1], of course, agreed, not wanting to be seen by the people as a [positive-personality-trait] person and therefore unfit to rule. They agreed to have the contest [rendezvous].</p>

        <p>As fate would have it, both [silly-name-2] and [silly-name-1] were consumed by [existential-threat-4] before the contest. It was for the best.</p>
